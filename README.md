A repository to learn how to use github efficiently.

When starting a new programming language, I always watch a Derek Banas viddeo on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1elmMBnykA&t=280s I find his videos short, informative and entertaining to watch as he always goes through the material at a good pace and gives examples to help better understand the quirks of each language.

I have never used python before so first step was to actually get it installed on my machine. I needed some help to do this and since i use atom as my text editor, i consulted the atom website, more specifically https://atom.io/packages/ide-python and installed python through the terminal. It was then easy to set up my first hello world program and from there I could make a lowest common ancestor program by consulting the c program. The biggest difference besides syntax was that python does not use pointers and there is no need to compile a python program before executing it.

I had considered using c++ or c# as they are fairly similar to c, but we are learning c++ in another module and c# is similar to java, so I decided to give python a shot as I've heard things about it.
