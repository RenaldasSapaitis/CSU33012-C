A repository to learn how to use github efficiently.

I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-in-a-binary-search-tree/ to get an implementation of the lowest common ancestor program for c.
I have never used python before so first step was to actually get it installed on my machine. I needed some help to do this and since i use atom as my text editor, i consulted the atom website, more specifically https://atom.io/packages/ide-python and installed python through the terminal. It was then easy to set up my first hello world program and from there I could easily make a lowest common ancestor program by consulting the c program. It was quite similar however the biggest difference besides syntax was that python does not use pointers. you also do not need to compile a python program before executing it if you have made changes so it skipped a simple gcc command in the terminal.
